# Sentiment-Score-for-task-scheduling-algorithms-based-on-text
Description : It aims to analyze a dataset of algorithms or models, focusing on the "Features" column to determine which algorithm has the best features based on the frequency and priority of adjectives used in their descriptions. Here's an overview of what the code does and some feedback:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing Pandas for data manipulation, regular expressions (re) for text processing, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

Reading the Dataset: Like the previous code, it reads a dataset from a given file path into a Pandas DataFrame.

Counting Adjective Frequencies: The code uses regular expressions to extract words from the "Features" column and counts the frequencies of adjectives. This approach differs from the previous code, which used SpaCy for natural language processing. This approach can capture adjectives effectively.

Calculating Adjective Priorities: Similar to the previous code, it calculates the priority of each adjective based on its frequency in the dataset relative to the total number of algorithms.

Calculating Algorithm Priority Scores: For each algorithm in the dataset, the code calculates a priority score by summing up the priorities of adjectives used in its "Features" description. This part is also similar to the previous code.

Identifying the Best Algorithm: The algorithm with the highest priority score is identified as the one with the best features and stored in the best_algorithm variable.

Data Visualization: The code visualizes the priority scores of algorithms using both a line plot and a bar plot, as in the previous code.

The code appears to accomplish its goal effectively. The choice of using regular expressions to extract adjectives from the text allows for flexibility in capturing adjectives, and it works well for this specific task.

Here are some suggestions for improvement and considerations, which are similar to those provided for the previous code:

Data Cleaning: Ensure that the dataset is clean and well-structured. Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

Plot Selection: Consider whether a bar plot or other visualization methods might be more effective for displaying the algorithm priorities.

Code Organization: Consider breaking down the code into functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability.

Documentation: Add comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and functionality of different sections of the code.

Error Handling: Implement error handling for potential issues, such as missing files or incorrect file paths.

Testing: Test the code with different datasets to ensure it behaves as expected in various scenarios.

Overall, this code is a valid approach to analyzing and visualizing the dataset to determine the algorithm with the best features based on adjective frequencies and priorities.
